# What is this about?

Just a fun doog-fooding hack with DERI data. I loaded the data about DERIans (encoded in RDFa) that is available via [http://www.deri.ie/about/team/](http://www.deri.ie/about/team/) into a SPARQL endpoint and performed a SPARQL query that selects team members names and images. I stored the JSON result of the SPARQL query and use it as a data source for the app. The app itself just selects a random DERIan from the available JSON data source and displays her or his name along with the picture.
